picamera (1.5-1) stable; urgency=low

  * The new picamera.array module provides a series of custom output classes
    which can be used to easily obtain numpy arrays from a variety of sources
    (#107)
  * The motion_output parameter was added to start_recording to enable output
    of motion vector data generated by the H.264 encoder. A couple of new
    recipes were added to the documentation to demonstrate this (#94)
  * The ability to construct custom encoders was added, including some
    examples in the documentation. Many thanks to user Oleksandr Sviridenko
    (d2rk) for helping with the design of this feature! (#97)
  * An example recipe was added to the documentation covering loading and
    conversion of raw Bayer data (#95)
  * Speed of unencoded RGB and BGR captures was substantially improved in both
    Python 2 and 3 with a little optimization work. The warning about using
    alpha-inclusive modes like RGBA has been removed as a result (#103)
  * An issue with out-of-order calls to stop_recording when multiple
    recordings were active was resolved (#105)
  * Finally, picamera caught up with raspistill and raspivid by offering a
    friendly error message when used with a disabled camera - thanks to Andrew
    Scheller (lurch) for the suggestion! (#89)

picamera (1.4-1) stable; urgency=low

  * The sei parameter was added to start_recording to permit inclusion of
    "Supplemental Enhancement Information" in the output stream (#77)
  * The awb_gains attribute was added to permit manual control of the
    auto-white-balance red/blue gains (#74)
  * A bug which caused split_recording to fail when low framerates were
    configured was fixed (#87)
  * A bug which caused picamera to fail when used in UNIX-style daemons,
    unless the module was imported *after* the double-fork to background was
    fixed (#85)
  * A bug which caused the frame attribute to fail when queried in Python 3
    was fixed (#80)
  * A bug which caused raw captures with "odd" resolutions (like 100x100) to
    fail was fixed (#83)
  * Added a workaround for full-resolution YUV captures failing. This isn't a
    complete fix, and attempting to capture a JPEG before attempting to
    capture full-resolution YUV data will still fail, unless the GPU memory
    split is set to something huge like 256Mb (#73)

picamera (1.3-1) stable; urgency=low

  * The bayer parameter was added to the 'jpeg' format in the capture methods
    to permit output of the camera's raw sensor data (#52)
  * The record_sequence method was added to provide a cleaner interface for
    recording multiple consecutive video clips (#53)
  * The splitter_port parameter was added to all capture methods and
    start_recording to permit recording multiple simultaneous video streams
    (presumably with different options, primarily resize) (#56)
  * The limits on the framerate attribute were increased after firmware #656
    introduced numerous new camera modes including 90fps recording (at lower
    resolutions) (#65)
  * It was reported that Exif metadata (including thumbnails) wasn't fully
    recorded in JPEG output (#59)
  * Raw captures with capture_continuous and capture_sequence were broken
    (#55)

picamera (1.2-1) stable; urgency=low

  * A bug introduced in 1.1 caused split_recording to fail if it was preceded
    by a video-port-based image capture (#49)
  * The documentation was enhanced to try and full explain the discrepancy
    between preview and capture resolution, and to provide some insight into
    the underlying workings of the camera (#23)
  * A new property was introduced for configuring the preview's layer at
    runtime although this probably won't find use until OpenGL overlays are
    explored (#48)

picamera (1.1-1) stable; urgency=low

  * A nasty race condition was discovered which led to crashes with
    long-running processes (#40)
  * An assertion error raised when performing raw captures with an active
    resize parameter was fixed (#46)
  * A couple of documentation enhancements made it in (#41 and #47)

picamera (1.0-1) stable; urgency=low

  * Debian packaging! (#12)
  * The new frame attribute permits querying information about the frame last
    written to the output stream (number, timestamp, size, keyframe, etc.)
    (#34, #36)
  * All capture methods, and the start_recording method now accept a resize
    parameter which invokes a resizer prior to the encoding step. This can be
    used to record video with full field-of-view (#21)
  * A new PiCameraCircularIO stream class is provided to permit holding the
    last n seconds of video in memory, ready for writing out to disk (or
    whatever you like) (#39)
  * There's a new way to specify raw captures - simply use the format you
    require with the capture method of your choice. As a result of this, the
    raw_format attribute is now deprecated (#32)
  * GPIO.cleanup is no longer called on close (#35), and GPIO set up is only
    done on first use of the led attribute which should resolve issues that
    users have been having with using picamera in conjunction with GPIO
  * Raw RGB video-port based image captures are now working again too (#32)
  * The continuous method was removed; this was replaced by capture_continuous
    in 0.5 (#7)

picamera (0.8-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Added capture of images whilst recording without frame-drop. Previously,
    images could be captured whilst recording but only from the still port
    which resulting in dropped frames in the recorded video due to the mode
    switch. In 0.8, use_video_port=True can be specified on capture methods
    whilst recording to avoid this.
  * Splitting of video recordings into multiple files. This is done via the
    new split_recording() method, and requires that the start_recording()
    method was called with inline_headers set to True. The latter has now been
    made the default (technically this is a backwards incompatible change, but
    it's relatively trivial and I don't anticipate anyone's code breaking
    because of this change).
  * Documentation updates that were missing from 0.7 (specifically the new
    video recording parameters)
  * The ability to perform raw captures through the video port
  * Missing exception imports in the encoders module (which caused very
    confusion errors in the case than an exception was raised within an
    encoder thread)

picamera (0.7-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Added quantisation and inline_headers options to start_recording() method
  * Fixed bugs in the crop property
  * The issue of captures fading to black over time when the preview is not
    running has been resolved. This solution was to permanently activate the
    preview, but pipe it to a null-sink when not required. Note that this
    means rapid capture gets even slower when not using the video port
  * LED support is via RPi.GPIO only; the RPIO library simply doesn't support
    it at this time
  * Numerous documentation fixes

 --  Dave Hughes <dave@waveform.org.uk>  Thu, 14 Nov 2013 20:03:00 +0000

picamera (0.6-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New raw format added to all capture methods (capture, capture_continuous,
    and capture_sequence) to permit capturing of raw sensor data
  * New raw_format attribute to permit control of raw format (defaults to
    'yuv', only other setting currently is 'rgb')
  * New shutter_speed attribute to permit manual control of shutter speed
    (defaults to 0 for automatic shutter speed, and requires latest firmware
    to operate - use sudo rpi-update to upgrade)
  * New "Recipes" chapter in the documentation which demonstrates a wide
    variety of capture techniques ranging from trivial to complex

 --  Dave Hughes <dave@waveform.org.uk>  Wed, 30 Oct 2013 01:28:00 +0000

picamera (0.5-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New capture_sequence() method
  * continuous() method renamed to capture_continuous(). Old method name
    retained for compatibility until 1.0
  * use_video_port option for capture_sequence() and capture_continuous() to
    allow rapid capture of JPEGs via video port
  * New framerate attribute to control video and rapid-image capture frame
    rates
  * Default value for ISO changed from 400 to 0 (auto) which fixes
    exposure_mode not working by default
  * intraperiod and profile options for start_recording()

 --  Dave Hughes <dave@waveform.org.uk>  Mon, 21 Oct 2013 02:06:00 +0000

picamera (0.4-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Added new attributes preview_alpha, preview_fullscreen, and preview_window
    for controlling the preview window
  * Added new continous() method for rapid capture of still images

 --  Dave Hughes <dave@waveform.org.uk>  Fri, 11 Oct 2013 01:37:00 +0000

picamera (0.3-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Added custom Exif tagging for captured images
  * Fixed silly bug which prevented more than one image being captured during
    the lifetime of a PiCamera instance
