Release 0.4
===========

In 0.4, several new attributes were introduced for configuration of the preview
window:

* :attr:`~picamera.PiCamera.preview_alpha`
* :attr:`~picamera.PiCamera.preview_fullscreen`
* :attr:`~picamera.PiCamera.preview_window`

Also, a new method for rapid continual capture of still images was introduced:
:meth:`~picamera.PiCamera.continuous`.

Release 0.3
===========

The major change in 0.3 was the introduction of custom Exif tagging for
captured images, and fixing a silly bug which prevented more than one image
being captured during the lifetime of a PiCamera instance.

Release 0.2
===========

The major change in 0.2 was support for video recording, along with the new
:attr:`~picamera.PiCamera.resolution` property which replaced the separate
``preview_resolution`` and ``stills_resolution`` properties.
